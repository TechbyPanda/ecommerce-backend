# Error Handling for Authentication

This code snippet implements error handling for authentication in a Node.js Express application. 

The `app.use` middleware function is used to catch any errors that occur during the processing of a request. The function takes in four arguments: `err`, `req`, `res`, and `next`. 

If an error is encountered, the error is passed as the first argument `err`. The code checks if `err` is truthy, and if it is, a JSON response is sent with a status code of `500` and a `message` property set to "error in server". This response indicates that an internal server error has occurred. 

This error handling mechanism ensures that the user receives a clear and concise response in the event of an error, helping to improve the user experience and make debugging easier.

```
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err) {
    res.status(500).json({message: 'error in server'});
  }
})
```
